Current issues:

Raft made server-side only but some jitter on the yaw is still present for some reason likely from the position being set somewhere else.

Things don't appear immediately on the client like arrows sometimes.

Something related to flying/gliding causing the player to not take fall damage after.

Turning on a VPN in-game crashes it.
